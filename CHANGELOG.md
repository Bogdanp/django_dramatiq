## [0.4.0] - 2018-07-11
### Added

### Added

- `DramatiqTestCase`

## [0.2.2] - 2018-01-06
### Fixed

  issue where the workers wouldn't boot when the `-no-reload` flag was
  set.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-01-06
### Added

- `--path` command line argument.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Python 3.5 is now supported.

## [0.1.4] - 2017-12-08
### Fixed

- Fixed use of `tobytes()` in `Task.message` for Django 2.0.

## [0.1.3] - 2017-11-20
### Added

- `--reload-use-polling` flag to force a poll-based file watcher
  instead of a OS-native one.  This is useful inside of Vagrant and
  Docker. ([Dramatiq #18])

[Dramatiq #18]: https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq/issues/18

## [0.1.2] - 2017-11-20
